## Architecture

Multi-module Android app (Kotlin) — a Material Design sudoku game.

**Modules:**
- **core** — Pure Kotlin module with game logic, solver (Dancing Links algorithm), and utilities. No Android dependencies.
- **app** — Main Android application. Two product flavors: `google` (Play Services) and `vanilla` (no Play Services).
- **solver** — Standalone sudoku solver Android app, depends on core.

**Key patterns:**
- **Hilt** for dependency injection (`@HiltAndroidApp`, `@HiltViewModel`, `@AndroidEntryPoint`)
- **RxJava 2** for async data flows in the repository layer
- **Room** for SQLite persistence, with a pre-populated asset database
- **ViewModel + LiveData** for UI state (puzzle screen); MVP presenters elsewhere (browse, scoreboard)
- Custom `PuzzleView` (Canvas-based) hierarchy: `GamePuzzleView` (interactive) and `PreviewPuzzleView` (read-only)

**Data flow:** Fragment → ViewModel/Presenter → PuzzleRepository (RxJava) → PuzzleDao (Room) → SQLite

**Game state:** `Game` class in core manages answers grid, candidate notes, and undo/redo via a move history stack (`Answer`, `Note`, `Clear` move types). `Sudoku` holds the puzzle definition (givens + solution). Grids are serialized as compact strings for database storage via `Format` utilities.

## Code Style

Enforced by Spotless with ktlint 0.43.2. Run `./gradlew spotlessApply` to auto-format before committing.
